### Personal Bio

I am an engineer, cat lover, trouble maker, solution provider, hiking enthusiast, and bike enthusiast. Always striving to learn more.

I believe that any complex problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems through the approach of divide and conquer. By independently solving each of these sub-problems, their solutions can be merged together to solve the original complex problem.

I also believe that any system or program should be designed and built with the goal of improving human life.
